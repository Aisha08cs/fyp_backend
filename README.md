EverydayEase Backend – README
🚀 Hosting Information
The backend is already hosted on Railway and fully integrated with the frontend.Running the frontend code is enough to use the app.
No local setup is required to run the app — this avoids sharing sensitive data from the .env file (e.g., database credentials and API keys).

🧪 Running Backend Tests Locally
If you'd like to run the backend tests:

📦 Prerequisites
Ensure Node.js is installed and configured in Visual Studio Code

🛠️ Setup & Run Tests
Open the backend folder in VS Code

In the terminal, run:

"npm install"
"npm test"
This will execute all backend API test cases.
